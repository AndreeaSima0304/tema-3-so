For treating the page faults I used the segv_handler function, which
finds the segment that produced SIGSEGV, and if none is found, it calls
the default handler. I find the page address and map it with mmap and
give it permissions with mprotect.
For reading from the input file I declared a file descriptor. 

I only implemented the Linux version.
The resources I used are lab4 and lab6 from SO labs.
